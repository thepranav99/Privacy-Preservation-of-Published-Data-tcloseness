# Privacy Preservation of Published Data t-closeness
ACHIEVING T-CLOSENESS USING PSO AND VALUE SWAPPING METHOD<hr>

<h4>Problem Statement:</h4>
Past two decades have seen a growing interest in methods for providing privacy preserving data publishing. Several models, algorithms have been proposed to protect identities in the published data. 
The most prevalent and famous technique is k- anonymity and l-diversity. But it has some limitations. To overcome these limitations, we have two techniques â€“ l diversity and t closeness. 
In this project we emphasize on t closeness and how we can achieve t closeness using PSO clustering algorithm and value swapping method.
